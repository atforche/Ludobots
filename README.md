## <a name="empty">Empty.py</a>
In this file, a default pyrosim simulation is created and visualized. This is primarily a test of the installation of the pryrosim package.

## <a name="objects">Objects.py</a>
This file is a basic test of the different objects and parameters that can be sent to the pyrosim simulation. Two cylinders are introduced to the simulated environment and manipulated using their input parameters.

## <a name="joints">Joints.py</a>
This file is a basic introduction to joints in the pyrosim simulation. Joints are created by connecting two objects in the simulation space via an anchor points. The axis of rotation of these joints can then be specified to determine in which ways the two objects are allowed to move relative to each other.
