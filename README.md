## <a name="empty">Empty.py</a>
In this file, a default pyrosim simulation is created and visualized. This is primarily a test of the installation of the pryrosim package.

## <a name="objects">Objects.py</a>
This file is a basic test of the different objects and parameters that can be sent to the pyrosim simulation. Two cylinders are introduced to the simulated environment and manipulated using their input parameters.
